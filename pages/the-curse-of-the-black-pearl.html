            <p><b><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i></b>: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film directed<br>
                by Gore Verbinski and the first film in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures<br>
                and Jerry Bruckheimer, the film is based on Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks.<br>
                The story follows pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) as they rescue the<br>
                kidnapped Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Hector Barbossa<br>
                (Geoffrey Rush), who become undead skeletons in moonlight.
            </p>
            <p><i>Jay Wolpert</i> developed a script in 2001, and <i>Stuart Beattie</i> rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer<br>
                Jerry Bruckheimer became involved in the project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding<br>
                the plot device of a supernatural curse to the story to bring it in line with the original theme park ride.<br>
                Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed<br>
                around Los Angeles, California.
            </p>

                Black Pearl had its world premiere at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, on June 28, 2003. Defying low<br>

                performance receiving universal acclaim. The film has been widely cited as the film that launched Depp as<br>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>In 1720, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica aboard the HMS Dauntless, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter<br>
                Elizabeth and crew encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate<br>
                medallion around his neck and takes it. Eight years later, Captain James Norrington is promoted to commodore<br>
                and proposes to Elizabeth. Her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea, causing the medallion to emit a pulse.<br>
                Captain Jack Sparrow, having just arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth. Norrington<br>
                identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith. They duel, and Jack<br>
                is imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal, searching for the medallion. The crew of the<br>
                Pearl captures Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal <br>
                her identity as the governor's daughter. Barbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that his crew <br>
                took from a treasure of Hernán Cortés on Isla de Muerta as a payment to stop the massacre against the Aztecs but Cortes,<br>
                being too greedy, rejected it, and the Aztec gods put a curse on the treasure. This cursed Barbossa and his crew, <br>
                turning them into immortals who appear skeletal in moonlight. Barbossa and his crew have returned all but one of <br>
                the pieces, with Elizabeth's medallion being the final piece. Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing she is the <br>
                daughter of William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, Will's father and a previous crewmate of the Pearl, whose blood is <br>
                needed to lift the curse
            </p>
            <p>Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves. Jack, the previous captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa <br>
                staged a mutiny, makes a deal with Will to reclaim his ship. The two commandeer HMS Interceptor, a small sloop-of-war, <br>
                and head for Tortuga. There, Jack enlists Gibbs to help them assemble a crew. Chasing the Pearl to the Isla de Muerta,<br>
                Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and returning the final gold piece. The curse is not lifted <br>
                because Elizabeth does not carry the blood of Bootstrap Bill. Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to the Interceptor, <br>
                while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked in the brig of the Pearl. The Pearl pursues the Interceptor, destroying the <br>
                ship and taking Jack's crew hostage. Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but <br>
                Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, marooning Jack and Elizabeth on an island. Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, <br>
                and Norrington brings the Dauntless to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth asks Norrington to pursue the Pearl and <br>
                save Will, persuading him by accepting Norrington's marriage proposal.
            </p>
            <p>That night, the Dauntless arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack tells Norrington he will lure the pirates out to be ambushed by <br>
                the crew of the Dauntless, but instead persuades Barbossa's crew to attack the Dauntless before they lift the curse and lose <br>
                their immortality. Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the Pearl. They refuse to rescue Jack <br>
                and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew depart aboard the Pearl. Jack again switches sides, freeing Will and <br>
                dueling Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen. When Barbossa stabs Jack, it is revealed that Jack took a <br>
                piece of gold from the chest and is likewise cursed and unable to die. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will returns both coins to the <br>
                chest with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted; Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew, <br>
                no longer immortal, are arrested. At Port Royal, Jack is to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention <br>
                while Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will. <br>
                Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Jack dives into the sea and escapes <br>
                aboard the nearby Pearl, reclaiming the ship and his new crew. Norrington permits Jack and the Pearl "one day's head start"<br>
                before initiating pursuit.
