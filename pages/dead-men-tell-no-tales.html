            <h2>Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017)</h2>
            <p><i><b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</b></i> (released internationally as Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge)<br>
                is a 2017 American swashbuckler fantasy film directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg and written by Jeff <br>
                Nathanson, from a story by Nathanson and Terry Rossio. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and distributed by Walt Disney <br>
                Studios Motion Pictures, the film is the sequel to On Stranger Tides (2011) and the fifth installment in the Pirates <br>
                of the Caribbean film series. It stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario,<br>
                and Kevin McNally.
            </p>
            <p>The filmmakers cited the series' first installment, The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), as inspiration for the script <br>
                and tone of the film, with critics describing the film as a "requel". Pre-production for the film started shortly <br>
                before On Stranger Tides was released in early 2011, with Terry Rossio writing the initial script. In early 2013, <br>
                Jeff Nathanson was hired to write a new script for the film, with Depp being involved in Nathanson's writing process. <br>
                Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed to 2016 and then to 2017, due to script and budget issues. <br>
                Principal photography started in Australia in February 2015, after the Australian government offered Disney $20 <br>
                million in tax incentives, and ended in July 2015. Dead Men Tell No Tales premiered in Shanghai on May 11, 2017, <br>
                and was released in the United States on May 26. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and <br>
                grossed <b>$795 million</b> worldwide against a production budget between $230 and 320 million.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>Thirteen years after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom, a twelve-year-old Henry Turner boards the Flying Dutchman <br>
               and informs his father, Will, that the curse which binds Will to the Dutchman and only permits him to step on land once <br>
               a decade can be broken by the Trident of Poseidon. Henry intends to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow to help find it, but <br>
                Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry <br>
                vows to find Jack and the Trident. Nine years later, Henry is a sailor in the Royal Navy. The ship sails into the <br>
                supernatural Devil's Triangle and stumbles upon the wreck of the Silent Mary, whose ghostly crew led by Spanish <br>
                pirate-hunter, Captain Armando Salazar, attacks, sparing Henry's life so that he can deliver a message to Jack, <br>
                who killed Salazar and his crew decades ago by leading them to the Devils Triangle and inadvertently cursed them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>On Saint Martin, a young astronomer named Carina Smyth is sentenced to death for witchcraft but escapes and crosses paths <br>
                with Jack as he and his crew botch a bank robbery, suffering from a spell of bad luck. Jack later trades his <br>
                compass for a drink, an act which destroys the Devil's Triangle and frees Salazar and his crew once more. Carina <br>
                learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Carina<br>
                and Jack stall the execution process, but they escape with the help of Henry and Jack's crew, setting sail on the <br>
                Dying Gull. Carina deciphers the clues in her diary, discovering that the stars will lead to an island where the <br>
                Trident is hidden. Meanwhile, Captain Hector Barbossa hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar <br>
                has killed several pirates at sea and is destroying Barbossa's fleet. Barbossa talks his way out of being killed <br>
                by offering to help find Jack and learns that the Trident could lead him to a "treasure". Salazar agrees, wanting <br>
                revenge on Jack. Salazar pursues the Dying Gull, forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering <br>
                that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the <br>
                miniaturized Black Pearl to its original size. They continue their journey to the island, with Barbossa taking <br>
                command of the Pearl once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The Pearl approaches the Trident's island and evades a Royal Navy warship until it is destroyed by the Silent Mary <br>
                before the Pearl runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean which <br>
                opens a path to the Trident on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and possesses him to walk on the ocean <br>
                floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back, and Jack distracts Salazar, allowing <br>
                Henry to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the <br>
                Trident's destruction causes the divided sea to close in on them. The Pearl lowers its anchor to lift the group to <br>
                safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when <br>
                she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary's cover, a trident star formation. Barbossa sacrifices himself<br>
                to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape. Sometime later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will<br>
                appears, free from the Dutchman. His wife, Elizabeth Swann, appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. <br>
                Henry and Carina kiss. Jack watches from the Pearl before sailing away into the horizon, captain once again, <br>
                while also adopting Captain Barbossa's monkey.
