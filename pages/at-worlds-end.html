            <h2>At World's End (2007)</h2>
            <p><b><i>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</i></b> is a 2007 American epic fantasy swashbuckler film directed by Gore Verbinski, <br>
                the third installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and the sequel to Dead Man's Chest (2006). It follows <br>
                Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl as they seek to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow <br>
                from Davy Jones' Locker. They then prepare to fight the East India Trading Company, led by Cutler Beckett, who controls <br>
                Davy Jones and plans to extinguish piracy forever. Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl <br>
                were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. The film was shot in <br>
                two shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former of which was released as Dead Man's Chest. This also marks the final film <br>
                of the series to be directed by Verbinski. With a production budget of nearly US$ 300 million, it was, at time of <br>
                production, the most expensive film ever made.
            </p>
            <p>Walt Disney Pictures released the film in the United States on May 18, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed; the film was <br>
                praised for its performances, direction, musical score, action sequences, humor and special effects, but was criticized <br>
                for its plot, character development and long running time of 169 minutes. Despite this, At World's End was the <br>
                highest-grossing film of 2007, bringing in over <b>$960 million</b>. It was nominated at the 80th Academy Awards for Best <br>
                Makeup and Best Visual Effects. It won favorite movie actor for Johnny Depp in 2008 Kids' Choice Awards. A sequel, <br>
                On Stranger Tides, was released May 20, 2011.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>To control the oceans, Lord Cutler Beckett executes anyone associated with piracy in Port Royal and orders Davy Jones to <br>
                destroy all pirate ships. Condemned prisoners sing "Hoist the Colours" to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at <br>
                Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court. Because Pirate Lord Jack Sparrow never named a successor before being dragged <br>
                to Davy Jones' Locker, Hector Barbossa, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the surviving crew of the Black Pearl <br>
                plot to rescue Jack. In Singapore, the crew meet Pirate Lord Sao Feng, who owns navigational charts to the Locker. Will <br>
                secretly promises to give Jack to Feng in return for the Pearl, intending to use it to rescue his father "Bootstrap Bill" <br>
                Turner from the Flying Dutchman. The crew rescue Jack and recover the Pearl. As they depart, they encounter boats of <br>
                dead souls, including Elizabeth's father Governor Swann, executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the goddess <br>
                Calypso charged Davy Jones with guiding the souls of those who died at sea to the next world; every ten years he <br>
                could come ashore to be with the woman he loved, but Jones corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. <br>
                Governor Swann reveals that whoever kills Jones by stabbing his disembodied heart must become the Dutchman's captain.
            </p>
            <p>Returning to the living world, the Pearl stops at an island for fresh water, but are attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. <br>
                As Jack secretly negotiates his freedom with Beckett, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is Calypso, while <br>
                the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the Pearl. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of a plan to seize <br>
                control of the Dutchman. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she <br>
                betrayed her lover, Davy Jones; Feng plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Feng is fatally wounded in an attack by <br>
                Jones, appointing Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig <br>
                of the Dutchman, where she finds Bootstrap Bill losing himself to the Dutchman's curse. Admiral James Norrington frees <br>
                Elizabeth and her crew from the Dutchman, but is killed by a crazed Bootstrap Bill. Will is rescued by Beckett and <br>
                informs Jones of Jack's escape from the Locker, learning in the process that Jones enabled the first Court to <br>
                imprison Calypso, revealed to be Tia Dalma. Meanwhile, the Pearl arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa <br>
                attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Jack's father, Captain Teague, informs the Court that <br>
                only an elected Pirate King can declare war. To avoid a stalemate, Jack votes for Elizabeth, making her King. <br>
                Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa, Beckett, Jones, and Will parley, trading Will for Jack. Barbossa frees Calypso, but when <br>
                Will reveals Jones' betrayal to her, Calypso vanishes and summons a maelstrom.
            </p>
            <p>The Pearl and Dutchman battle in the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa in the midst of the battle. On <br>
                the Dutchman, Jack and Jones duel for control of Jones' heart. After Jones mortally wounds Will, Jack helps Will stab <br>
                the heart, killing Jones. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman as it sinks into the maelstrom. As Beckett's ship, <br>
                the Endeavour, engages the Pearl, the Dutchman rises from the sea, now captained by Will and its crew freed from <br>
                Jones' curse. The two pirate ships destroy the Endeavour, killing Beckett. With Will bound to guide souls lost at <br>
                sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth <br>
                pregnant and with the chest containing his heart. Barbossa mutinies against Jack and steals the Pearl again <br>
                to find the Fountain of Youth, but finds that Jack has stolen Feng's charts. Jack departs from Tortuga to <br>
                track the fountain down.
