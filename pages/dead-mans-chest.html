            <h2>Dead Man's Chest (2006)</h2>
            <p><i><b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</b></i> is a 2006 American fantasy swashbuckler film. It is<br>
                the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and the sequel to Pirates of the <br>
                Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). It was directed by Gore Verbinski, written by Ted <br>
                Elliott and Terry Rossio, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. In the film, the wedding of <br>
                Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is interrupted by <br>
                Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who wants Turner to acquire the compass of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)<br>
                in a bid to find the Dead Man's Chest. Sparrow discovers his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is due.
            </p>
            <p>Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and<br>
                Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming took place from February to September 2005 in<br>
                Palos Verdes, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, and The Bahamas, as well as on sets constructed at Walt<br>
                Disney Studios. It was shot back-to-back with the third film of the series, At World's End (2007). Dead Man's Chest<br>
                was released in the United States on July 7, 2006, and received mixed reviews, as the film received praise for its<br>
                special effects, direction, action sequences, Hans Zimmer's musical score, humor, and performances, particularly<br>
                those of Depp and Nighy, but criticism for its running time and plot. The film broke several records at the time,<br>
                including the opening-weekend record in the United States with <b>$136 million</b>, the fastest film to gross over $1 billion<br>
                at the worldwide box office (63 days), became the highest-grossing film of 2006, and was the highest-grossing film<br>
                produced by Disney until it was surpassed by Toy Story 3 in 2010. The film received four nominations at the 79th<br>
                Academy Awards (winning Best Visual Effects).

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is halted when Lord Cutler Beckett, chairman of the East India Trading Company, <br>
                arrives with arrest warrants for them, and also for Commodore James Norrington, who allowed Captain Jack Sparrow to escape. <br>
                Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless, in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. <br>
                Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, aboard the Black Pearl. Bootstrap is a crewman on the <br>
                Flying Dutchman, captained by Davy Jones. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the Pearl from the depths, and <br>
                must now join the Dutchman's crew or be dragged to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Meanwhile, Beckett promises to free <br>
                Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magical compass, which points to whatever the holder wants most. Will finds Jack and the <br>
                crew on an island and frees them from cannibals. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit voodoo priestess <br>
                Tia Dalma, who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, locked within the Dead Man's Chest; Jack intends to find it and free <br>
                himself from Jones' service. Locating the Dutchman, Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for <br>
                Jack's compass, but is tricked into joining Jones' crew in Jack's stead. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain <br>
                in exchange for ninety-nine more souls. Will meets his father aboard the Dutchman and learns that Jones possesses the <br>
                key to the chest. Despite losing a game of Liar's Dice to Jones, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same <br>
                ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him and sinks the ship, but Will again escapes.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth's father Governor Swann frees her from jail but is captured himself. Elizabeth bargains with <br>
                Beckett to find the compass herself and makes her way to Tortuga, where she finds both Jack and a drunken Norrington. <br>
                Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington, and Elizabeth uses the compass to find the chest. <br>
                All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, <br>
                Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken and <br>
                negate his debt to Jones; Will wants to release his father from the Dutchman; and Norrington wants to regain his <br>
                life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away <br>
                the Dutchman's crew. Jones attacks the Pearl with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but <br>
                one of the Pearl's lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly fled the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net <br>
                full of gunpowder and rum.
            </p>
            <p>Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains <br>
                him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker, but Jones opens<br> 
                the chest and discovers his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the Letters of Marque <br>
                meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy, as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. <br>
                The Pearl's crew takes shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who <br>
                will guide them: the resurrected Hector Barbossa.
