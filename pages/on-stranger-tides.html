            <h2>On Stranger Tides (2011)</h2>
            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a 2011 American fantasy swashbuckler film, the fourth installment in <br>
                the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and a standalone sequel to At World's End (2007). It is the first film in the<br> 
                series not to be directed by Gore Verbinski, replaced by Rob Marshall. Jerry Bruckheimer again served as producer. <br>
                In the film, which draws its plot loosely from the 1987 novel On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers, the eccentric pirate <br>
                Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is forced into a shaky alliance with Angelica (Penélope Cruz), a mysterious woman <br>
                from his past, as they embark on a quest for the Fountain of Youth, confronting the infamous pirate Blackbeard <br>
                (Ian McShane) and outrunning Jack's old foe Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).
            </p>
            <p>The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was the first film in<br>
                the series to be released in the Disney Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D formats. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio first learned<br>
                of Powers's novel On Stranger Tides during the back-to-back production of Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End, and <br>
                considered it a good starting point for a new film in the series. Pre-production started after the end of the 2007/2008 W<br>
                riters Guild of America strike, with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. Principal photography <br>
                lasted for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and <br>
                California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar, and ten <br>
                companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs which ballooned the net <br>
                budget to $379 million, the film currently ranks as the most expensive film ever made. On Stranger Tides was released <br>
                in the United States on May 20, 2011. It received mixed reviews from critics for its screenplay and lack of <br>
                originality, but received praise for its performances, visual effects, and action scenes. The film broke many box <br>
                office records and was the third highest-grossing film of 2011. A fifth film, titled Dead Men Tell No Tales, was <br>
                released in May 2017, and a sixth film is in development.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>In the middle of the 18th century, a man is rescued from the ocean off the Spanish coast and brought to King Ferdinand<br>
                of Spain, where he claims to be a crewmate of Juan Ponce de León, who disappeared 200 years ago searching for the <br>
                Fountain of Youth. Seventeen years after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom, after a failed attempt to rescue <br>
                his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs, from execution in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II. <br>
                The king asks Jack to guide an expedition to locate the Fountain of Youth, before King Ferdinand and the Spanish <br>
                Navy locate it. Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer, and sporting a peg leg, is captaining the expedition, <br>
                though only requires Sao Fengs navigational charts, rather than Jack.
            </p>
            <p>Jack escapes, meeting his father, Captain Teague, who tells Jack that the Fountain requires a ritual to use. Jack learns an <br>
                impersonator is recruiting pirates for another expedition. The imposter is Angelica, Jack's former lover, and daughter <br>
                of the legendary Blackbeard. Jack is shanghaied into service onboard Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge. <br>
                Blackbeard survived his historic death using voodoo magic, due to a predestined, fatal encounter with Barbossa. He wields <br>
                the Sword of Triton, which allows him to control his ship. Though Jack leads a mutiny, Blackbeard subdues the crew <br>
                into obedience. Amongst the crew is Philip Swift, a captured missionary. Barbossa recruits Gibbs, who burns the charts, <br>
                admitting he memorised every location. Jack is told by Angelica that two silver chalices must be retrieved from Ponce <br>
                de León's flagship, the Santiago. A mermaids tear must be placed in one chalice, and both chalices must be drunk <br>
                simultaneously to activate the Fountain's healing properties. The drinker who lacks the tear will die, their lifeforce <br>
                given to the other. Jack discovers Blackbeard's collection of captured, miniaturised ships, including the Black Pearl. <br>
                The Revenge sails to Whitecap Bay to capture a mermaid, successfully netting Syrena, who they, at first, must <br>
                carry in a glass container. When Syrena is dropped, her tail turns into legs. Philip, caring for her,<br>
                (and seeing she cannot walk) offers to carry her.
            </p>
            <p>Angelica and Blackbeard send Jack to get the chalices, taking his magic compass as a bargaining chip. Jack meets Barbossa <br>
                on the Santiago, but find the chalices have been taken by the Spanish. Retrieving the chalices, Barbossa explains Blackbeard <br>
                attacked the Black Pearl, leading to the loss of his leg via self-amputation. Syrena's tear is extracted by <br>
                Blackbeard after Philip expresses love for her, leaving her to die of dehydration, and Philip is forced to go <br>
                with the crew. Jack returns, bargaining for the return of his compass in exchange for the chalices. When Blackbeard <br>
                agrees, Jack sends Gibbs off on an errand. Blackbeard's crew locate the Fountain, but are confronted by Barbossa<br>
                and his men. The Spanish arrive, condemning the Fountain as an abomination against God, throwing the chalices<br>
                into a deep pool. In the chaos, Philip frees Syrena, who retrieves the chalices, returning them to Jack. <br>
                Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with his poisoned sword, steals the Sword of Triton, declares himself captain of <br>
                the Revenge, and returns to a life of piracy. The Spanish crush the Fountain before leaving. Angelica cuts <br>
                her hand on the poisoned sword. Jack retrieves remaining drops of water from the Fountain, adding Syrena's <br>
                tear to one of the chalices. When Blackbeard asks Angelica to die for him, Jack tricks him into drinking the <br>
                chalice lacking the tear. Angelica is healed, whilst Blackbeard dies. Syrena returns to an injured Philip, <br>
                kisses him, and guides him underwater to an unknown fate. Jack maroons Angelica on a cay, unsure if he can <br>
                trust her. Afterwards, he reunites with Gibbs, who used Jack's compass to locate the Revenge, retrieving the <br>
                bottled Black Pearl. In a post-credits scene, a voodoo doll of Jack created by Blackbeard washes ashore onto <br>
                Angelica's cay.
