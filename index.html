            <h1>Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)</h1>
            <p><i><b>Pirates of the Caribbean</b></i> is a Disney media franchise encompassing numerous theme park rides,<br>
                a series of films, and spin-off novels, as well as a number of related video games and <br>
                other media publications. The franchise originated with the theme park ride of the same name,<br>
                which opened at Disneyland in 1967 and was one of the last Disneyland rides overseen<br>
                by Walt Disney. Disney based the ride on pirate legends, folklore and novels, such<br>
                as those by Italian writer Emilio Salgari.
            </p>
            <p><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> became a media franchise in the 2000s with the release of <br>
                The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003; it was followed by four sequels. The films <br>
                created by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide <br>
                by 2019, putting the film franchise 14th in the list of all-time highest-grossing<br>
                franchises and film series. The rides can be found at five Disney theme park resorts.
            </p>
            <p>The series is noted for its high quality of acting talent. The visual and practical effects <br>
                are considered some of the best ever done on film, so much so that audiences believed <br>
                certain CGI elements of the films were real and done practically. However, the plots <br>
                of the four sequels have received mixed reviews, with the general consensus that they <br>
                are too bloated and convoluted to follow. Pirates of the Caribbean is noted for <br>
                reinvigorating the pirate film genre after decades of either no pirate films or <br>
                failed pirate films.
